        <!-- Lake description -->
        <p>
            Laguna Brava Ecotourism is an organization run by <em>local community members</em> based in Laguna Brava.
            Laguna Brava is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karstic lake</a> of incomparable beauty
            located in western Guatemala.
            Laguna Brava is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region, so reaching and exploring the lake
            takes a mix of extreme adventure and intimate contact with nature. The lake beauty lies in the colours
            variety of its waters, which depends on the sun's position. Laguna Brava is also known as Yolnabaj by the
            region's inhabitants, which translates as "rough lake". Despite its name, the waters of Laguna Brava Laguna
            are so calm that they instantly awaken a deep feeling of peace.
